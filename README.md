  3. Users can log out of their account
3. Published
  1. Recipes will display if marked published

# Currently Implemented
### Azure SQL Server with 2 databases
1. Application Database
Used to store user created data such as recipes and ingredients. Contains all data and tables required for business logic.

2. User Authentication Database
Contains all the ASP.NET Identity tables and user information, maintained separately from the application database to reduce how often user data is in transit.

3. Entity Framework Core
Code first model scaffolding to keep precise entity relationships. Grants users permission to utilize CRUD operations in order to store their customized recipes.

4. User-Secrets Manager
Protect application secrets in the producation environment.

5. ASP.NET IDENTITY (full UI scaffolded to add further constraints to account behavior)
Safe user account management as to avoid writing my own hash algorithms and improperly storing user passwords. The full suite of functions is not currently being utilized, future implementations may occur as needed.

6. SendGrid API
Allows accounts to be confirmed through email confirmation.
<br/>
7. BootStrap 4
Utilized for the basic stylizing and animations of the application.
